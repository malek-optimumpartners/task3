Create a CICD using GitHub actions to build the custom docker Image and push it to the Images registry,
then deploy the built Image to our training server.

Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that will:

Build Docker images for both the front-end and back-end applications.

Push the built images to the GitHub Container Registry.

Connect the applications to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).

Deploy the Docker images to our training server.

Ensure the entire workflow is fully functional
